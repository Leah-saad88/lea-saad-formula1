// i started first with card on my old file i had to copy paste everything and it look awkward like bad
//the cards were designed nicely but it didnt look like wow that was a nice idea
// i tried animation it was basic and i looked up different animation and cam across this ai helped me across
// new information learned and i believe that i will be using motion framer a lot knowing what it can do make coding much more fun
